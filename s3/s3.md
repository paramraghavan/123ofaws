## Object in S3
Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets. An object is composed of a file and any metadata that describes that file. To store an object in Amazon S3, you upload the file you want to store into a bucket. When you upload a file, you can set permissions on the object and add any metadata.

Buckets are logical containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets in your account and can control access for each bucket individually. You control who can create, delete, and list objects in the bucket. You can also view access logs for the bucket and its objects and choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents.

Amazon S3 holds buckets. Each bucket contains objects. Each object is a single file with its associated metadata.

## Accessing your content
Once objects have been stored in an Amazon S3 bucket, they are given an object key. Use this, along with the bucket name, to access the object.
Below is an example of a URL for a single object in a bucket named doc, with an object key composed of the prefix 2006-03-01 and the file named AmazonS3.html.

This is an example of a URL for a single object in a bucket named doc inside of a folder named 2006-03-01 with the file name AmazonS3.html.
An object key is the unique identifier for an object in a bucket. Because the combination of a bucket, key, and version ID uniquely identifies each object, you can think of Amazon S3 as a basic data map between "bucket + key + version" and the object itself. Every object in Amazon S3 can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service endpoint, bucket name, key, and (optionally) version.

## Advantages of using Amazon S3 as the storage platform for your data analysis solution.

### Decoupling of storage from compute and data processing
With Amazon S3, you can cost-effectively store all data types in their native formats. You can then launch as many or as few virtual servers needed using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and use AWS analytics tools to process your data. You can optimize your EC2 instances to provide the correct ratios of CPU, memory, and bandwidth for best performance. Decoupling your processing and storage provides a significant number of benefits, including the ability to process and analyze the same data with a variety of tools.

### Centralized data architecture
Amazon S3 makes it easy to build a multi-tenant environment, where many users can bring their own data analytics tools to a common set of data. This improves both cost and data governance over traditional solutions, which require multiple copies of data to be distributed across multiple processing platforms. Although this may require an additional step to load your data into the right tool, using Amazon S3 as your central data store provides even more benefits over traditional storage options.

### Integration with clusterless and serverless AWS services
Combine Amazon S3 with other AWS services to query and process data. Amazon S3 also integrates with AWS Lambda serverless computing to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Amazon Athena can query Amazon S3 directly using the Structured Query Language (SQL), without the need for data to be ingested into a relational database.
With all of these capabilities, you only pay for the actual amounts of data you process or the compute time you consume.





> Difference between s3n, s3a and s3
> - The letter change on the URI scheme makes a big difference because it causes different software to be used to interface to S3. Somewhat like the difference between http and https - it's only a one-letter change, but it triggers a big difference in behavior.
> - The difference between s3 and s3n/s3a is that s3 is a block-based overlay on top of Amazon S3, while s3n/s3a are not (they are object-based).
> - The difference between s3n and s3a is that s3n supports objects up to 5GB in size, while s3a supports objects up to 5TB and has higher performance (both are because it uses multi-part upload). s3a is the successor to s3n.
> - If you're here because you want to understand which S3 file system you should use with Amazon EMR, then read [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20170718025436/https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/emr-file-system-s3/) from Amazon (only available on wayback machine). The net is: use s3:// because s3:// and s3n:// are functionally interchangeable in the context of EMR, while s3a:// is not compatible with EMR.
