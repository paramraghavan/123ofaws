Many of my friends who are on IT are not working on AWS or only getting to AWS now, so thought of putting something that helps them. Probably be useful for aws beginners and intermediates

- iam
- s3
- lambda
- api gateway
- serverless framework, see serverless.com
- vpc
- ec2
- step functions/state machine
- AWS Fargate

Usually at work we have single AWS account per emvironment(dev/test/acpt/prod) with multiple roles. These roles are assigned to active directory user ids.

AWS Elastic Cloud  Compute Service or EC2 is IaaS(Infrastructure as a Service). This is because Amazon takes the responsibility of networking, storage, server and virtualization and the user is responsible for managing the Operating System, middleware, runtime, data and application. In PaaS aka Platform as a Service the user only needs to take care of data and application, the management of rest of the layers lies in hands of the service provider. AWS Elastic BeanStalk is PaaS
